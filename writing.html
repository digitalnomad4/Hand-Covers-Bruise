      <h2>Style.</h2>
      <pre>Style is the answer to everything.
        A fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing
        To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it
        To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art Bullfighting can be an art
        Boxing can be an art
        Loving can be an art
        Opening a can of sardines can be an art</pre>

        <pre>I have met men in jail with style.
        I have met more men in jail with style than men out of jail.
        Style is the difference, a way of doing, a way of being done.</pre>

        
      
   
    
 
      <pre>Not many have style
      Not many can keep style
      I have seen dogs with more style than men,
      although not many dogs have style.
      Cats have it with abundance.</pre>
      <div class="skill-row">
       <pre> When Hemingway put his brains to the wall with a shotgun,
        that was style.
        Or sometimes people give you style
        Joan of Arc had style
        John the Baptist
        Jesus
        Socrates
        Caesar
        García Lorca.
        or you, naked, walking out of the bathroom without seeing me.
